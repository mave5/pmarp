'''

There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays ( The median of the array formed by merging both the arrays ).
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

A : [1 4 5]
B : [2 3]
[1 2 3 4 5] => 3
[1 4 5 2 3]
- simple solution: merge two arrays and then find median: O(n+m)
- different cases
